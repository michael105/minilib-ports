## minilib-ports



Compilation of small programs, compiled with [minilib](https://github.com/michael105/minilib),
serving as testcases.

Some are modified, some unchanged (besides the file minilib.conf).

Ideally, they should compile unmodified; 
yet most problems have been a result of unwanted optimizations by gcc.

However, especially the network stack of minilib seems to be a bit 'unmature'. 
(or there might be slight differences to glibc/musl).
Bug reports/fixes are very welcome.


I collect the tools along with the static builds here.


The directory ./bin_x64 contains static binaries for linux, 64bit;
built with gcc 9.3 (Gentoo).
