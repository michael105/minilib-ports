## minilib-ports



Different ports of small programs to minilib,
serving as testcases.

Some are modified, some unchanged (besides the file minilib.conf).


I collect them along with the static builds here.


The directory ./bin_x64 contains static binaries for linux, 64bit;
built with gcc 9.3 (Gentoo).
